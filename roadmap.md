# Roadmap

All remaining work for CommitLLM, organized by priority. Items numbered sequentially within each tier.

Mark a task done only when it is true in code, tests, docs, and operational behavior. Completed milestones live in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

The shell/tail/binding protocol is structurally complete. The kept path preserves the full exact 7-matrix Freivalds shell (`Wq/Wk/Wv/Wo/Wg/Wu/Wd`) across all audit tiers; tiers differ in attention evidence and payload cost, not in whether the exact linear shell is checked.

---

## Tier 0 — Critical path

Highest-priority work. Do in this order.

| # | Item | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **RMSNorm contraction / local operator — MEASURED** — crude contraction ratio `ρ_j = γ·‖W_o‖₂/RMS(x^(j))` and tighter local sensitivity/operator tests have now been run on real checkpoints. **Qwen-7B W8A8**: crude contraction mixed; tighter local operator puts 21/28 layers below 1, but 3 layers (0, 1, 27) can still individually flip the output and many middle layers remain near the margin. **Llama-3.1-8B**: crude contraction fails everywhere and tighter local operator still leaves 0/32 layers below 1; 6 layers can individually flip the output. Conclusion: contraction and local linearization are useful diagnostics, but they do not rescue the corridor by themselves. Next step: refine the local map further with prompt diversity and the full within-layer propagation channel. Subtests: projected norm `‖J_RMSNorm(x_j) W_o^(j)‖`, head-aware/block-aware operators, mixed `∞→∞` and `∞→2` bounds consistent with the protocol corridor, finite-difference local sensitivity on real traces, and inclusion of the MLP propagation channel after the perturbed residual enters the rest of the layer. | **measured** |
| 2 | **Shrink the honest corridor** — measure and reduce τ at the source. Experiments: (a) **better `a` quantization** — per-head scales instead of per-tensor, INT16/FP16 retained `a` instead of INT8; (b) **alternative attention backends** — eager attention, deterministic CUDA, less-fused kernels; (c) **layer/head-specific tolerances** — calibrate τ per layer per family, tighten dangerous layers (24-25 Qwen, 31 Llama) to τ=1. These are the cheapest path to reducing the gap without changing the protocol shape. See `research/attention-gap.md` §3d–3f. | open |
| 3 | **Real-model corridor attacks — PARTIALLY MEASURED** — multi-prompt finite-difference sensitivity measured: Qwen 28/28 layers flip on every prompt, Llama 0–6 flips depending on margin. All-layers-simultaneously always flips. Remaining: constrained adversarial optimization (true worst-case under L∞), multi-token accumulation across autoregressive decode. See `research/attention-gap.md` §1e, §3l–3m. | **partial** |
| 4 | **Unify attention path** — one `x_attn` boundary, one QKV replay story across prover/verifier/corridor. No silent mixing of bridge-derived Q with committed K/V. | open |
| 5 | **Adversarial testing** — cheating-provider test suite: receipt forgery, transcript splicing, intermediate tampering, model substitution, selective layer cheating, KV injection, and selective-abort / audit-policy gaming. Every attack must fail verification or be documented as accepted gap. Includes real-model constrained corridor attacks (see #3). | **in progress** |
| 6 | **Formal security argument** — define the cheating game, state Freivalds soundness bound (1/p), state detection probability as f(sampling rate, cheating fraction), state what commitment binding prevents. Include random audit conditioning analysis: detection probability vs cheating fraction vs audit rate. | open |
| 7 | **KV provenance** — sampled/batched Freivalds checks verify committed K/V are consistent with committed Wk/Wv weights and bridge inputs. Tightening `a` alone is insufficient if the adversary can manipulate prefix state; KV provenance closes the upstream path. Even perfect current-token attention only proves correctness relative to the committed prefix. | open |
| 8 | **Score witnessing** — commit pre-softmax scores S=Q·K^T/√d per audited token. Verifier checks S against canonical QK^T from shell-verified Q and committed K, then recomputes softmax(S)·V independently. **Confirmed critical by #1**: Llama has ρ>1 at every layer, corridor is structurally exploitable. Design: always witness the generated token (exact, not sampled), Fiat-Shamir sample prefix tokens for probabilistic coverage. Test partial variants first: worst-layer only, worst-head only, top-k scores + certified tail bound. Not needed if #2 achieves τ≈0. Cost: O(seq_len × n_heads) per audited token per layer, deep audit only. | open |
| 9 | **W_o conditioning** — compute σ_min(W_o), ‖W_o‖₂, and more faithful projected/local operator bounds per layer on real models. **Confirmed critical by #1**: Llama ρ>1 everywhere means the crude spectral bound is loose — need tighter per-layer operator norms to identify which layers genuinely amplify vs where the bound is just conservative. Quantifies adversary freedom when attn_out_i8 is commitment-bound but not independently replayed. Also translate hidden-state drift into per-layer logit-margin bounds using the real LM head, and measure margin-plus-frequency on real prompts to see when dangerous layers actually coincide with small output margins. | open |
| 10 | **Deep-audit payload sizing** — budget the per-token cost of score witnessing and KV provenance at production context lengths (4K, 32K, 128K). Determine storage, bandwidth, and verification-time scaling. **Must benchmark CPU verification time in the Rust verifier**, not estimate from FLOPs (likely memory-bound). Note: for Fiat-Shamir-sampled decode tokens, average prefix length applies, not max context. Informs audit tier design and whether long-context deployments need different policies. | open |
| 11 | **Rename to CommitLLM** — all docs, APIs, CLI, scripts, packages use `CommitLLM`. | open |
| 12 | **Remove V4/V5 naming** — public surface uses one canonical release name, not internal version numbers | open |
| 13 | **Clean repo** — delete stale corridor/debug paths, one-off hooks, duplicate helpers, obsolete protocol-era code. Repo should reflect the kept path, not an archaeology of experiments. | open |
| 14 | **GPU smoke tests** — maintained GPU tests exercise token-0 attention replay and deep-prefix on the canonical verifier | open |
| 15 | **Freeze canonical verifier** — canonical verifier is the frozen trusted path; legacy verifier no longer needed. Fresh real-GPU confirmation via `test_e2e_v4.py` and `test_adversarial.py`. | partial |
| 16 | **Adversarial methodology research** — move from defender testing (flip bits, check rejection) to attacker simulation (white-box forgery, adaptive adversary, composition attacks, probabilistic security curves). See [`research/adversarial-methodology.md`](./research/adversarial-methodology.md). | open |
| 17 | **Fuzz binary parsers** — coverage-guided fuzzing (cargo-fuzz) on verifier's binary deserialization. Malformed receipts fail closed, never panic. | open |
| 18 | **Stable benchmark protocol** — fix workload corpus, model/settings, warmup, hardware class, reporting format | open |
| 19 | **Benchmark routine-audit path** — baseline, online overhead, commit time, audit-open time, verifier time, retained-state size, payload size | open |
| 20 | **Paper/README/article consistency** — claims match code match measurements. See [Docs detail](#docs--publication-detail) below. | open |
| 21 | **v1.0 release** — cut clean tagged release only when code, benchmarks, docs, and claims all line up | open |

---

## Tier 1 — Security hardening

Blocks credibility with serious reviewers.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 21 | **Trust assumptions review** — enumerate exact, approximate, statistical, fail-closed, and out-of-scope assumptions; check against code and claims |
| 22 | **Freshness / temporal binding** — verifier-issued nonce or timestamp in receipts; prevent replay of cached honest responses. Also define selective-abort / denial-of-audit policy: response deadlines, retention horizon, and what evidence is required when a provider refuses or misses an audit. |
| 23 | **Tolerance bounds** — analytical attention-gap story for the kept path. Empirical data exists (Qwen L∞=8, Llama L∞=9); a full composed theorem does not. Do not assume plain per-layer `L∞` alone gives a strong semantic guarantee. Use norm-consistent bounds: if the corridor is stated in `L∞`, the downstream analysis must use compatible induced norms or explicitly justify the `L2`/spectral relaxation. Combine per-step corridor bounds with the local operator measurements from #1, real-model attack evidence from #2, `W_o` conditioning (#8), and score witnessing (#7) where needed. Add margin-based safety as an operational corollary where full worst-case theorems are too loose. RMSNorm contraction is supporting evidence, not the primary fix. |
| 24 | **Audit tiers** — formalize receipt-only / routine / deep / full with explicit coverage and cost per tier |
| 25 | **Guarantee language** — docs clearly separate exact (Freivalds/INT8), bounded approximate (attention), statistical (sampled provenance), and fail-closed |
| 26 | **Verifier-key distribution** — canonical procedure for trusted key provenance, hash pinning, historical lookup, fail-closed on unknown keys |
| 27 | **Key rotation** — key versions tracked; old receipts remain auditable with historical key |
| 28 | **Verifier-secret randomness** — one canonical verifier-secret randomness story. Make explicit which claims rely only on secrecy (single Freivalds check soundness `≈ 1/p`) and which rely on independence (cross-layer amplification, if claimed). If the protocol keeps shared `r_j` per matrix family, document that this is sufficient for base per-check soundness but does not provide multiplicative amplification across layers. If stronger composed claims are desired, derive per-layer Freivalds randomness from a verifier-secret seed. Deep-audit batching randomness and challenge selection must remain unpredictable until after commitment. |

---

## Tier 2 — Model breadth

Without broader model support, CommitLLM is a Qwen+Llama demo, not a product.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 29 | **MoE support** — verify expert routing decisions and per-expert shell matmuls for Mixtral, DeepSeek-V2/V3, Qwen-MoE. Commit router logits/top-k, Freivalds on selected expert weights, fail-closed on unsupported routing. |
| 30 | **FP8 quantization** — validated capture/replay/verification for FP8 (E4M3/E5M2) on Hopper/Blackwell. Capture layer needs FP8 `scaled_mm` wrappers; verifier needs FP8 dequant and bridge replay. |
| 31 | **Third family** — Mistral, Gemma, or strongest alternative measured on the kept path. Proves not overfit to two architectures. |
| 32 | **Larger model** — at least one 30B/70B-class datapoint on the corrected path |
| 33 | **Long-context 128K+** — validate corridor at production context lengths where attention numerics are most stressed |
| 34 | **GPTQ/AWQ/grouped quant** — at least one non-W8A8 family with a fully validated verifier replay path |
| 35 | **Verification profiles** — per-family configuration (tolerance table, context lengths, audit policy) under the same core protocol |

---

## Tier 3 — Performance & serving compatibility

Determines whether CommitLLM is deployable at production throughput.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 36 | **Native capture backend** — C++/CUDA/Triton hot path replacing Python interception. Milestones: (a) profile dominant cost, (b) prototype native `cutlass_scaled_mm` hook with ring buffer, (c) benchmark vs Python path, (d) integrate. Also enables CUDA graph compat (#44). |
| 37 | **Cross-request prefix caching** — committed prefix receipt referenced by subsequent requests. Highest-impact unsupported optimization (~2-5x TTFT). Prefix cache becomes first-class committed object. |
| 38 | **Test continuous batching** — tracer splits batched prefill into per-token traces; commit+audit+verify on real GPU with concurrent requests |
| 39 | **Test paged attention** — paged KV doesn't interfere with committed KV transcript integrity |
| 40 | **Test tensor parallelism** — TP=2 and TP=4 produce valid receipts. Startup hook patches TP workers but needs real multi-GPU confirmation. |
| 41 | **Test fused kernels** — fused QKV and gate-up projections produce correct shell accumulators, pass Freivalds |
| 42 | **Test FlashAttention** — attention outputs within established corridor bounds with FA enabled |
| 43 | **Test more W8A8 families** — overlaps with #31 and #32 |
| 44 | **CUDA graph compatibility** — capture hooks survive graph replay. Largely solved by #36. Impact: ~10-30% decode latency. |
| 45 | **Speculative decoding** — commit draft model identity, draft tokens, acceptance masks. New sub-protocol for accept/reject transcript. Impact: ~2-3x generation latency. |
| 46 | **LoRA/adapter verification** — verifier confirms served weights match `base + adapter`. Model spec already hashes adapter identity. |
| 47 | **Pipeline parallelism** — PP configs produce valid receipts. Capture layer handles cross-GPU activation transfers. |
| 48 | **Lower online overhead** — complete remaining cost work or consciously stop if returns are too small |
| 49 | **Reduce audit payload** — lossless shell compression: width-packed accumulators, tighter binary layouts. Don't drop shell matrices. |

---

## Tier 4 — Production infrastructure

Needed for real multi-tenant deployment.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 50 | **Streaming / SSE** — incremental commitments during token-by-token streaming; partial receipts before generation completes |
| 51 | **Multi-turn binding** — chain receipts across conversation turns (hash of prior receipt in next commitment) |
| 52 | **Monitoring / observability** — export metrics: failure rate, corridor histograms, audit latency, buffer utilization, receipt throughput (Prometheus/OTel) |
| 53 | **Receipt storage** — indexing by request ID, time, model, verification status. Append-only log, object store, or blockchain anchoring. |
| 54 | **Verifier deployment** — hosted service vs client-side library vs hybrid. Address key distribution, receipt transport, offline vs real-time. |
| 55 | **Receipt compression** — compact aggregate receipts or compressed streams at thousands of req/sec |
| 56 | **Audit delegation** — verifier delegates authority to trusted third-party auditor. Define trust model, revocation. |
| 57 | **OpenAI-compatible proxy** — standard API with receipt metadata, challenge endpoint, verifier CLI |
| 58 | **Client SDKs** — Python and TypeScript wrappers for receipt handling and verification |
| 59 | **Reference client flow** — one canonical CLI: trusted key → receipt → served output → challenge → audit → coverage interpretation |
| 60 | **Startup self-checks** — fail closed on model-identity mismatch, bad capture settings, unsupported config |
| 61 | **Architecture detection** — unsupported families detected explicitly, not silently treated as Llama-style |
| 62 | **Buffer-pressure behavior** — capture and audit-state buffer overflow is explicit and tested |
| 63 | **Retention behavior** — audit-state TTL, cleanup, and purge are explicit and tested |
| 64 | **Health checks** — server reports capture hook, audit buffer, model identity, verified-mode health |
| 65 | **Abuse protection** — audit requests rate-limited, bounds-checked, no amplification |
| 66 | **EOS-trim evidence** — real-GPU test: EOS-before-max_tokens triggers trim, commit+audit+verify passes |

---

## Tier 5 — Strengthening & research

Important for the long-term story but not blocking anything above.

| # | Item |
|---|------|
| 67 | **Deterministic inference mode** — eager attention (`attn_implementation="eager"`), `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`, fixed CUDA seeds. If the forward pass is bit-exact and the verifier replays with the same arithmetic spec, τ=0 closes the attention gap for opened tokens without score witnessing. Requires a defined arithmetic/kernel spec for cross-hardware determinism — "deterministic on one GPU" is not enough. Note: τ=0 alone does not solve prefix anchoring; replay only proves consistency with committed prefix, not true earlier execution. KV provenance (#5) or deep audit still needed for upstream trust. Measure throughput cost vs FlashAttention. |
| 68 | **Deterministic attention kernel** — custom Triton/CUDA attention with fixed accumulation order, deterministic reductions. Measure corridor=0. May be slower than FlashAttention. |
| 69 | **Cheating-incentive analysis** — quantify cost/benefit of model substitution, detection probability vs audit sampling rate, equilibrium conditions |
| 70 | **Lean formalization** — machine-checked core verification claims |
| 71 | **Non-Rust verifier** — independent implementation consuming golden vectors |
| 72 | **llama.cpp plugin** — capture retained state from llama.cpp serving path |
| 73 | **Marketplace integration** — providers attach receipts, clients challenge through market surface |
| 74 | **Receipt encryption** — encrypt receipts/audit payloads to verifier's public key |
| 75 | **Generalized retained state** — schema-driven format beyond constant-width decoder models |
| 76 | **Full shell recomputation** — bandwidth-light, verifier-heavy mode. Future experiment requiring local weights. |
| 77 | **Receipt-format spec** — binary format documented independently of implementation |
| 78 | **API extensions** — serving API carries receipt metadata in stable, documented way |
| 79 | **Remove legacy verifier** — delete `verify_v4_legacy` after soak period |
